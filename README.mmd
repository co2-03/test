## Implementation approach

We will develop a Python-based command-line interface (CLI) blackjack game. The game will be structured around a main game loop handling user inputs and game logic. We'll use the built-in `random` module for card shuffling and dealing. The `cmd` module will be utilized to create an interactive command-line interface, providing a clear and intuitive user experience as outlined in the requirements.
